# Homebridge SleepIQ

In my origin readme, I had a statement: 

> So far, I have not seen Sleep Number get upset with too many requests, but in theory they could at some point in time if we flood their network.

Unfortunately, that day has come. I received a call from Sleep Number requesting I take down this plugin as it is overwhelming their network and making the SleepIQ experience worse for everybody, and it is a direct violation of their User Agreement. This update removes all functionality (you will need to remove the accessories from HomeKit). If you choose not to update, Sleep Number will likely blacklist your IP Address and reach out to you directly as they work through the list of users with massive amounts of API requests. 

I requested that they keep our small community in mind and give us a proper API with local network access in the future. I don't know if they ever will, but if they call you, please add your request to mine, make our voices heard. 

Thanks for all the good times and keep sleeping,

Dillan
