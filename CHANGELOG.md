## v4.1.1 (2020-09-17)

### Note

- You will like run into an issue when updating that is preventing homebridge from running. Try removing the bed0privacy device from the device cache (or just clear the full cache). I updated how I handled this device in the plugin and it is conflicting with the version stored in the cache. 

## v4.1.0 (2020-09-17)

### Changes

- Added initial foot warmer support for flexfit 3 foundations. I don't have a foundation, so if you find any bugs, or something isn't working right, please file a ticket.
- Set a step size for the sleep number slider so it is easier to hit the number you are aiming for.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in API call for foundation outlets and light strips

## v4.0.0 (2020-09-17)

### Changes

- Added initial support for foundation outlets and light strips
  - This release introduces initial support for the outlets and light strips on the flex fit foundations that have them. I don't personally have one, so please report any issues when using them. If the light strips are capable of brightness control, I do not support that either. I need REST data to add that capability.
